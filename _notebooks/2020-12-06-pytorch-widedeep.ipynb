    "This is the first of two posts introducing [pytorch-widedeep](https://github.com/jrzaurin/pytorch-widedeep), which is intended to be a flexible package to use Deep Learning (hereafter DL) with tabular data and combine it with text and images via wide and deep models. `pytorch-widedeep` is partially based on Heng-Tze Cheng et al., 2016 [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07792) [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "in this post I describe the data preprocessing functionalities of the library, the main components of the model, and the basic use of the library. In a second post I will show a more advance use of `pytorch-widedeep`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before I move any further I just want to emphasize that there are a number of libraries that implement functionalities to use DL on tabular data. To cite a few, the ubiquitous and fantastic [FastAI](https://docs.fast.ai/tutorial.tabular.html) (and their tabular api), the \"rising star\" [NVTabular](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVTabular), the powerful [pytorch-tabnet](https://github.com/dreamquark-ai/tabnet) based on work of Sercan O. Arik and Tomas Pfisterfrom [2], which is starting to take victories in Kaggle competitions, and perhaps my favourite [AutoGluon Tabular](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06505) [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not my intention to \"compete\" against these libraries. `pytorch-widedeep` started as an attempt to package and automate an algorithm I had to use a couple of times at work and ended up becoming the entertaining process that is building a library. Needless to say that if you wanted to apply DL to tabular data you should go and check all the libraries I mentioned before (as well as this one 🙂). \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Installation \n",
    "\n",
    "To install the package simply use pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pytorch-widedeep\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or directly from github\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install git+https://github.com/jrzaurin/pytorch-widedeep.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note for Mac Users**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the following comments are not directly related to the package, but to the interplay between `pytorch` and `OSX` (more precisely `pytorch`'s dependency on `OpenMP` I believe) and in general parallel processing in Mac. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first place, at the time of writing the latest `pytorch` version is `1.7`. This version is known to have some [issues](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64772335/pytorch-w-parallelnative-cpp206) when running on Mac and the data-loaders might not run in parallel. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, since `Python 3.8` the `multiprocessing` library start method changed from ['fork' to 'spawn'](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#contexts-and-start-methods). This also affects the data-loaders (for any torch version) and they will not run in parallel. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, for Mac users I suggest using `python 3.7` and `torch <= 1.6` (with its corresponding `torchvision` version, i.e. `<= 0.7.0`). I could have enforced this versioning via the `setup.py` file. However, there are a number of unknowns and I preferred to leave it as it is. For example I developed the package using *macOS Catalina* and maybe some of this issues are not present in the new release *Big Sur*. Also, I hope that they release soon a patch for `pytorch 1.7` and some, if not all these problems disappear. \n",
    "\n",
    "Installing `pytorch-widedeep` via `pip` will install the latest version. Therefore, if these problems are present and the dataloaders do not run in parallel, one can easily downgrade manually: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install torch==1.6.0 torchvision==0.7.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*None of these issues affect Linux users*"

    "## 2. `pytorch-widedeep`  DL Architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "As I mentioned earlier `pytorch-widedeep` combines tabular data with text and images via wide and deep models. \n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, the two main architectures that can be built with a few lines of code using `pytorch-widedeep` are:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](figures/pytorch-widedeep/arch_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architecture 1**: architecture 1 combines the `Wide`, linear model with the outputs from the `DeepDense` or `DeepDenseResnet`, `DeepText` and `DeepImage` components connected to a final output neuron or neurons, depending on whether we are performing a binary classification or regression, or a multi-class classification. The components within the faded-pink rectangles are concatenated. Later in the post I will describe in detail each of the individual components.\n",
    "\n",
    "In math terms, and following the notation in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07792), Architecture 1 can be formulated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "preds = \\sigma(W^{T}_{wide}[x, \\phi(x)] + W^{T}_{deepdense}a^{(l_f)}_{dense} + W^{T}_{deeptext}a^{(l_f)}_{text} + W^{T}_{deepimage}a^{(l_f)}_{image} + b) \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $W$ are the weight matrices applied to the wide model and to the final activations of the deep models, '$a$' are the final activations, and $\\phi(x)$ are the cross product transformations of the original features '$x$'. In case you are wondering what are *\"cross product transformations\"*, here is a quote taken directly from the paper: *\"For binary features, a cross-product transformation (e.g., “AND(gender=female, language=en)”) is 1 if and only if the constituent features (“gender=female” and “language=en”) are all 1, and 0 otherwise\"*.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](figures/pytorch-widedeep/arch_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architecture 2**: architecture 2 combines the `Wide`, linear model with the `Deep` components of the model connected to the output neuron(s), after the different `Deep` components have been themselves combined through a Fully-Connected-Head (hereafter FC-Head) (that I refer as `DeepHead`).\n",
    "\n",
    "In math terms, and following the notation in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07792), Architecture 2 can be formulated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "preds = \\sigma(W^{T}_{wide}[x, \\phi(x)] + W^{T}_{deephead}a^{(l_f)}_{deephead} + b)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Is important to mention that each individual component, `wide`, `deepdense` (either `DeepDense` or `DeepDenseResnet`), `deeptext` and `deepimage`, can be used independently and in isolation. For example, one could use only `wide`, which is in simply a linear model. Or use `DeepDense` which is in essence a similar implementation to that of the [Tabular](https://docs.fast.ai/tabular.learner) API in the `fastai` library (which I strongly recommend).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Quick start (TL;DR)\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe I should have started with this section, but I thought that knowing at least the architectures one can build with `pytorch-widedeep` was \"kind-off\" necessary. In any case and before diving into the details of the library, let's just say that you just want to quickly run one example and get the feel of how `pytorch-widedeep` works. Let's do so using the [adult census dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we will be fitting a model comprised by two components: `Wide` and `DeepDense`."

I also have a travel cot for a baby for guest with small children.  I will require a deposit up front as a security gesture on both our parts and will be given back to you when you return the keys.  I trust anyone who will be responding to this add would treat my home with care and respect .  Best Wishes  Alina Guest will have access to the self catering kitchen and bathroom.

    "\n",
    "This is the first of 2 posts introducing the python library `pytorch-widedeep`. This library is intended to be a flexible frame to combine tabular data with text and images via wide and deep models. Of course, it can also be used directly on \"traditional\" tabular data, without text and/or images, as we saw in Section 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post I have shown how to quickly start using the library (Section 3) and explained the utilities available in the `preprocessing` module (Section 4) and and model component definitions (Section 5), available in the `models` module. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the next post I will show more advance uses that hopefully will illustrate `pytorch-widedeep`'s flexibility to build wide and deep models. \n",
