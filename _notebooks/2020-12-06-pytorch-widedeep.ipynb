    "This is the first of a series of posts introducing [pytorch-widedeep](https://github.com/jrzaurin/pytorch-widedeep), which is intended to be a flexible package to use Deep Learning (hereafter DL) with tabular data and combine it with text and images via wide and deep models. `pytorch-widedeep` is partially based on Heng-Tze Cheng et al., 2016 [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07792) [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "in this post I describe the data preprocessing functionalities of the library, the main components of the model, and the basic use of the library. In a separate post I will show a more advance use of `pytorch-widedeep`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before I move any further I just want to emphasize that there are a number of libraries that implement functionalities to use DL on tabular data. To cite a few, the ubiquitous and fantastic [FastAI](https://docs.fast.ai/tutorial.tabular.html) (and their tabular api), NVIDIA's  [NVTabular](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVTabular), the powerful [pytorch-tabnet](https://github.com/dreamquark-ai/tabnet) based on work of Sercan O. Arik and Tomas Pfisterfrom [2], which is starting to take victories in Kaggle competitions, and perhaps my favourite [AutoGluon Tabular](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06505) [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not my intention to \"compete\" against these libraries. `pytorch-widedeep` started as an attempt to package and automate an algorithm I had to use a couple of times at work and ended up becoming the entertaining process that is building a library. Needless to say that if you wanted to apply DL to tabular data you should go and check all the libraries I mentioned before (as well as this one 🙂. You can find the source code [here]((https://github.com/jrzaurin/pytorch-widedeep))). \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Installation \n",
    "\n",
    "To install the package simply use pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pytorch-widedeep\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or directly from github\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install git+https://github.com/jrzaurin/pytorch-widedeep.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note for Mac Users**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the following comments are not directly related to the package, but to the interplay between `pytorch` and `OSX` (more precisely `pytorch`'s dependency on `OpenMP` I believe) and in general parallel processing in Mac. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first place, at the time of writing the latest `pytorch` version is `1.7`. This version is known to have some [issues](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64772335/pytorch-w-parallelnative-cpp206) when running on Mac and the data-loaders might not run in parallel. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, since `Python 3.8` the `multiprocessing` library start method changed from ['fork' to 'spawn'](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#contexts-and-start-methods). This also affects the data-loaders (for any torch version) and they will not run in parallel. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, for Mac users I suggest using `python 3.7` and `torch <= 1.6` (with its corresponding `torchvision` version, i.e. `<= 0.7.0`). I could have enforced this versioning via the `setup.py` file. However, there are a number of unknowns and I preferred to leave it as it is. For example I developed the package using *macOS Catalina* and maybe some of this issues are not present in the new release *Big Sur*. Also, I hope that they release soon a patch for `pytorch 1.7` and some, if not all these problems disappear. \n",
    "\n",
    "Installing `pytorch-widedeep` via `pip` will install the latest version. Therefore, if these problems are present and the dataloaders do not run in parallel, one can easily downgrade manually: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install torch==1.6.0 torchvision==0.7.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*None of these issues affect Linux users*"

    "## 2. `pytorch-widedeep`  architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "In general terms, `pytorch-widedeep` is a package to use deep learning with tabular data. In particular, is intended to facilitate the combination of text and images with corresponding tabular data using wide and deep models. With that in mind there are a number of architectures that can be implemented with just a few lines of code. The main components of those architectures are shown in the Figure below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](figures/pytorch-widedeep/widedeep_arch.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The dashed boxes in the figure represent optional, overall components, and the dashed lines/arrows indicate the corresponding connections, depending on whether or not certain components are present. For example, the dashed, blue-arrows indicate that the `deeptabular`, `deeptext` and `deepimage` components are connected directly to the output neuron or neurons (depending on whether we are performing a binary classification or regression, or a multi-class classification) if the optional `deephead` is not present. Finally, the components within the faded-pink rectangle are concatenated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that it is not possible to illustrate the number of architectures and components available in ``pytorch-widedeep`` in one Figure. This is why I wrote before \"overall components\", because within the components represented by the boxes, there are a number of options as well. Therefore, for more details on possible architectures (and more) please, see the [documentation](https://pytorch-widedeep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), or the Examples folders and the notebooks in the [repo](https://github.com/jrzaurin/pytorch-widedeep).\n",
    "\n",
    "In math terms, and following the notation in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07792), the expression for the architecture without a ``deephead`` component can be formulated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "preds = \\sigma(W^{T}_{wide}[x, \\phi(x)] + W^{T}_{deeptabular}a^{(l_f)}_{dense} + W^{T}_{deeptext}a^{(l_f)}_{text} + W^{T}_{deepimage}a^{(l_f)}_{image} + b) \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $W$ are the weight matrices applied to the wide model and to the final activations of the deep models, $a$ are these final activations, and $\\phi(x)$ are the cross product transformations of the original features $x$. In case you are wondering what are \"*cross product transformations*\", here is a quote taken directly from the paper: \"*For binary features, a cross-product transformation (e.g., “AND(gender=female, language=en)”) is 1 if and only if the constituent features (“gender=female” and “language=en”) are all 1, and 0 otherwise*\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While if there is a ``deephead`` component, the previous expression turns into:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "preds = \\sigma(W^{T}_{wide}[x, \\phi(x)] + W^{T}_{deephead}a^{(l_f)}_{deephead} + b)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to emphasize that **each individual component, `wide`, `deeptabular`, `deeptext` and `deepimage`, can be used independently** and in isolation. For example, one could use only `wide`, which is in simply a linear\n",
    "model. In fact, one of the most interesting offerings in ``pytorch-widedeep`` is the ``deeptabular`` component, and I intend to write a dedicated post focused on that component alone. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, while I recommend using the ``wide`` and ``deeptabular`` models in ``pytorch-widedeep`` it is very likely that users will want to use their own models for the ``deeptext`` and ``deepimage`` components. That is perfectly\n",
    "possible as long as the the custom models have an attribute called ``output_dim`` with the size of the last layer of activations, so that ``WideDeep`` can be constructed. Again, examples on how to use custom components can be found in the Examples folder in the repo. Just in case ``pytorch-widedeep`` includes standard text (stack of LSTMs) and image\n",
    "(pre-trained ResNets or stack of CNNs) models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Quick start (TL;DR)\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe I should have started with this section, but I thought that knowing at least the architectures one can build with `pytorch-widedeep` was \"kind-off\" necessary. In any case and before diving into the details of the library, let's just say that you just want to quickly run one example and get the feel of how `pytorch-widedeep` works. Let's do so using the [adult census dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we will be fitting a model comprised by two components: `wide` and `deeptabular`."

    "`pytorch-widedeep` offers one model that can be passed to `WideDeep` as the `deeptext` component, `DeepText`, which is a standard and simple stack of LSTMs on top of word embeddings. You could also add a FC-Head on top of the LSTMs. The word embeddings can be pre-trained. In the future I aim to include some simple pre-trained models so that the combination between text and images is fair.\n",

    "On the other hand, while I recommend using the `wide` and `deeptabular` models within this package when building the corresponding wide and deep model components, it is very likely that the user will want to use custom text and image models. That is perfectly possible. Simply, build them and pass them as the corresponding parameters. Note that the custom models MUST return a last layer of activations (i.e. not the final prediction) so that these activations are collected by `WideDeep` and combined accordingly. In addition, the models MUST also contain an attribute output_dim with the size of these last layers of activations.\n",

    "## 6. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first of a series of posts introducing the python library `pytorch-widedeep`. This library is intended to be a flexible frame to combine tabular data with text and images via wide and deep models. Of course, it can also be used directly on \"traditional\" tabular data, without text and/or images.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post I have shown how to quickly start using the library (Section 3) and explained the utilities available in the `preprocessing` module (Section 4) and and model component definitions (Section 5), available in the `models` module. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the next post I will show more advance uses that hopefully will illustrate `pytorch-widedeep`'s flexibility to build wide and deep models. \n",
